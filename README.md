####*Partial Convolution and image inpainting for synthetic maps*
1. Git clone the project
2. Run python3 map_generation.py to generate synthetic map database
3. Run python3 patch_generation.py to generate masks for ground truth images
4. Run python3 train.py for training. This takes approximately 8 hours to generate results with the default parameters set in model
